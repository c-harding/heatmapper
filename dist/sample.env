# PORT is the port used for hosting the server.
# You should leave it as 8080 (or blank), or make sure to update the port in Dockerfile (the line
# starting with EXPOSE) and `docker-compose.yml` too (in the `ports:` block, update both
# occurrences of 8080 with the new port).
SERVER_PORT=8080

# SERVER_DOMAIN is the address for serving the client on. This is required unless the deployed
# instance is only going to be accessed from a browser on the same computer.
#
# If a domain is provided, it should contain everything before the first slash of the path,
# including the port (unless it is accessible through the default port, i.e. 80 for http or
# 443 for https), e.g. one of:
#   SERVER_DOMAIN=https://heatmapper.charding.dev
#   SERVER_DOMAIN=http://192.168.1.2:345
#
# If a SERVER_DOMAIN is provided, it must match the callback domain specified at
# https://www.strava.com/settings/api

# The following items are used for deploying to a remote server (`./deploy`).
# The host should be an IP address/domain name that accepts ssh connections, or the name of a host
# as specified in ~/.ssh/config .
# All the other parameters are optional. You must wrap any values containing dollars, spaces or
# other special character in single quotes, as these options will be interpreted by bash directly.
# If DEPLOY_KEYPAIR is a relative path, it should be given relative to the parent directory, the
# root of the repository.
